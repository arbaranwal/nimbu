host# Packet Type

URL receives 2 types of packets : Command and Data.
Command packet is a fixed message of 3 bytes, while a Data packet can be upto 8 bytes.

# MESSAGE FRAME

```
|--------|--------|-------->
   HEAD    COMMAND   DATA
```

## HEAD

The `HEAD` byte is made up of two fields: a 4-bit `START` sequence and a 4-bit `LENGTH` number.  
The value of the `START` sequence is a nonce, which is generated from a *context* established during the security handshake (see *Security* section below).
The maximum value of `LENGTH` shall be open to implementation, constrained to a lower bound. The device is expected to send this value during the capability exchange after the security handshake.

The `COMMAND` byte is broken into two fields : 5-bit `OPCODE` and 3-bit `COLOUR`

### OPCODE

The MSB in the OPCODE determines whether a frame denare
The mnemonics are with respect to the application host, not the device. For example, `GET_TIME` involves data transfer from Slave to Master.

> Need to revise this. Device needs to send back only limited commands.

### COLOUR

The colour field determines the targeted colour.

|COLOUR|Description|
|:---:|:---:|
|000|Default|
|001|Red|
|010|Green|
|011|Blue|
|100|Warm White|
|101|Cool White|
|11x|Reserved|


### PHASE

When used with the `REx_SEC` opcode, the `COLOUR` field determines a `PHASE` number, which is used to denote different steps in establishing an authorised connection.

## CONTROL BYTE

Control Byte contains the routing information and toggles the state of active channels.

```
pos     7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
route   L   T   M   B   U   P   F   R
```

| L | Watch External Light Levels |
| P | Pulse (Breather Mode) |
| U | User |
| B | Bass |
| M | Mid |
| T | Treble |

## SECURITY

The implementation of security-features in this standard is aimed at replay protection instead of data encryption. However, encrypting every message easily exceeds the computation budget, violating real-time constrains. The focus of the security feature is to keep data encrypted, while keeping the computational overhead minimal, while preventing MITM attacks.

URL uses a secure handshake at the application-layer to guard against brute-force injections and replay attacks. This makes it agnostic to the protocol and medium being used, although injecting marginal compuatation overhead.  
This handshake follows a specific flow which grants the host a leased, authorised connection.
The `COLOUR` field determines a `PHASE` number for `REx_SEC` operations.


## Phase 1

1. Sost sends a security request command (`REQ_SEC`), for which the data-payload defaults to 16 bytes. This data payload contains the ECDSA public key of the host. The device sends back a security response command (`RES_SEC`), with its own public key.
2. The device initialises a 63-bit LFSR at a random seed, encodes it with its private key and the host's public key, and streams this packet. The host waits against a timeout until it receives a `RES_SEC-PHASE2`. Upon reception, the host creates a `REQ_SEC-PHASE2`, encoding the next LFSR sequence using its own private key and the device's public key.
3. The third phase marks the creation of a security `CONTEXT`. The data transmitted by the host within `REQ_SEC-PHASE2` serves as the first `CONTEXT`.
    * For each device transaction (request received + response sent), the device pulses its LFSR.
    * For each host transaction (request sent + received response), the host controller pulses its LFSR.
    * For each transaction, the mask over the entire packet is assumed to be the last active `CONTEXT`.
    * If the `CONTEXT` received by the device does not match the expected value at the device's end, a `NACK` is sent.
    * If the `CONTEXT` received by the host does not match the expected value at the host's end, the `CONTEXT` is assumed to be out of sync. The only way to assume control of the device is to re-initiate the security handshake.

NACKs : In case of `CONTEXT` out-of-sync, the 1 byte data packet for the `NACK` is reserved to be 0x00

---

> Not needed because the `SNIPPET` is already masked with the context

The `SNIPPET` is generated by using the value of the last populated `0x07 & LENGTH` field.  

Inside the LFSR data structure, the bit present at the position `0x07 & LENGTH` in each less-significant 4 bytes are extracted to form the `SNIPPET` nibble.
This adds another small layer of protection, because only 4 bits can be used to prevent replay attacks.
